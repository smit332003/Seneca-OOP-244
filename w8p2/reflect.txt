In this workshop 8 we made a total of 10 files including the main file and combination of header files and .cpp files. First, in the implementation of this workshop we declared Class Hierarchy and after that implemented some of the classes. Call iAccount, Account,saving account, chequing account and the allocator module. After that in the iAccount interface, the following pure virtual public member functions are implemented.call bool credit(double), bool debit(double), void monthend(),void display(std::ostream&) const. In this interface we also declared a public empty virtual destructer call iAccount* CreateAccount(const char*, double). Then we have made public constructors and methods as well. So, after going through all the given overview we ended up with the expected output. By making this workshop we learned how to define a pure virtual function and abstract base class. Also, we got to know about differentiation of abstract base class and a concrete class. Finally after going through all the required steps I ended up with the correct output of the workshop 8 part 2.
